# Web forms with accessing database

*There are three components to creating a web form that are important
  * Presentation Layer (WebForm)
  * Business Logic Layer (BLL - SystemClassLibrary)
  * Data Access Layer (DAL - SystemClassLibrary)
* The BLL and the DAL should be seperate folders under a class library called '....system'
* In the BLL Folder, there should be a Controller class
  * This Controller.cs file will help us with CRUDmaintenance of our database
  
## Make sure that the namespace you are using are:
* The other class library
* the DAL folder
* the any other folders in the same class library.
  
* In the DAL, 
* There should be anothe class library that will hold the classes that represent the database table names
